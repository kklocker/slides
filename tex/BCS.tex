	The Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity is the most celebrated microscopic theory describing the macroscopic phenomena of superconductivity. In this theory, an effective attractive potential between electrons in vicinity of the Fermi surface leads to the condensation of ``Cooper pairs'', reducing the free energy of the system. After some crude simplifications, a model Hamiltonian reads

	{\large
		
		\begin{equation*} 
			\mathcal{H} = \sum_{k, \sigma}\varepsilon_kc_{k\sigma}^{\dagger}c_{k\sigma}  + \sum_{k, k'}V_{kk'}c_{k \uparrow}^{\dagger}c_{-k \downarrow}^{\dagger}c_{k'\downarrow}c_{k'\uparrow},
		\end{equation*}
	}

		where $V_{kk'}$ is attractive in a thin shell close to the Fermi surface. This attractive potential can for instance be mediated by interacting with quantized lattice vibrations -- phonons.

		Since this Hamiltonian is quartic in fermion-operators, solving it exactly is very difficult. However, a mean field treatment is possible by letting $c_{-k\downarrow}c_{k\uparrow} = \ev*{c_{-k\downarrow}c_{k\uparrow}}$ + fluctuations, and the system might be solved.

		where $\beta = \frac{1}{k_BT}$.
		This is a ``gap''-equation precisely because the condensation of Cooper pairs opens a gap $\Delta_k$ in the electronic excitation spectrum. A goal of modern physics is to find systems whose superconducting gap is as large as possible.

		The computation of $\Delta_k$ often requires heavy numerical computations, but some further analytic work can be done by assuming a constant attractive potential up to a Debye energy, where it is taken to be zero. 
		Remarkably, it turns out that the ratio of the gap $\Delta_k$ at zero temperature to the critical temperature (the temperature where $\Delta_k = 0$) is a purely numerical constant given by

		where $\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. This constant fits fairly well with the experimentally observed values for several materials, and reason to celebrate the BCS - theory as a whole.
