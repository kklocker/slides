		The field operators of a system is written as the single-particle wave function times a creation / annihilation operator which increases or decreases the occupancy of said state, summed over all available states in the system.

		The time-dependency of $c_\alpha^\dagger$ is determined by the Hamiltonian of the system, and is in the Heisenberg picture written as
		\begin{equation*}
			c_\alpha^\dagger(t) = \e^{i\hat{H}t}c_\alpha^\dagger\e^{-i\hat{H}t}
